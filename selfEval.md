1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    - I spent about an hour and 45 minutes on this assignment because I went way more in depth than I probably needed to and tackled the spicy challenge. This was about 45 minutes over my time estimate but I think it was worth it because I learned everything in a much greater depth.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I would like to go back and try the other challenges. I will have to adjust my calendar.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - I answered most of my questions using mozilla dev docs and w3 schools. The only questions I have left are about looping and if the terminal will accept input.
